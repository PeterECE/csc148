    """A Grocery Store simulation.

    Attributes:
    - _events: A sequence of events arranged in priority order determined by
            the event comparison methods. For any two events e1 and e2,
            if e1 < e2 then e1 will come out of the event queue before e2.
            If e1 == e2 (according to the event comparison defined by __eq__),
            then the event that was inserted *earlier* is the first one to be
            removed.
    - _store: The store being simulated.
    - stats: Summary statistics for the simulation, with these keys and values:
            'num_customers': the total number of customers in the simulation
            'total_time': the timestamp of the last event
            'max_wait': the maximum amount of time a customer waited
      All statistics begin at 0 and are updated as each event is handled.

    Representation Invariants:
    - For every event in self._events that involves a checkout line number n,
      0 <= n <= self._store.num_lines.
